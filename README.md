# DHProject_PNA_Onomastics
A project for Digital Humanities Project Course on Neo-Assyrian names.

The data used in this project has been originally collected as part of the Prosopography of Neo-Assyrian (PNA) project which is part of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project State Archives of Assyria (SAA). Both SAA and PNA were directed by Simo Parpola at the University of Helsinki. PNA includes names from all the known Neo-Assyrian sources. The texts are from the Neo-Assyrian period from 883 BC to 602 BC. The corpus of names does not only contain names that are in Akkadian, but names in at least ten different languages are inclued in the corpus. The corpus of names was published in three volumes from 1998 to 2011 edited by Karen Radner (volume 1) and Heather D. Baker (volumes 2-3).  Some of the data has already been published at the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (ORACC), but most of the corpus is still missing from the online corpus. The data has been further processed by Tero Alstola and Heidi Jauhiainen who are part of the Centre of Excellence in Ancient Near Eastern Empires’ Team 1.

Akkadian names were not necessarily just single words, but often they were sentence-like constructions with clear meanings. Such as Abu-ul-īde = I don’t know the/my father or Arad-Bābu = Servant of Bābu or Dullupu = sleepy. Akkadian names are not usually translated in text editions, but they are just written in transliterated Akkadian. Names are quite easy to recognize in the text, because they tend to have determinatives that also indicate whether the carrier of the name was feminine or masculine.

I removed all the names that were not in Akkadian and filtered my dataset so that only the names classified as masculine remained. I classified the time periods of the names so that each one consisted of approximately 50 years.  50% of the names actually are from  649-600 BC which is the most recent period included in this study.
